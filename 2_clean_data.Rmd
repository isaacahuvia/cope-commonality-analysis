```{r data imputation}
#8/14/25: We originally planned to impute missing data using "missForest". We then ran initial analyses 
#using the resulting imputed data and found similar results as we did when we reran analyses on complete 
#cases. Given limitations of "missForest()", we ultimately decided not to use it (and used complete cases 
#instead). Thus, the following code related to "missForest" is commented out.

#Change numeric-coded and integer-coded categorical variables into factors and make cope_ca_ssi_completers 
#a data.frame for "missForest" to work
#cope_ca_ssi_completers <- as.data.frame(cope_ca_ssi_completers) %>% 
#  mutate(across(c(pi_dropout, b_drs_month, f1_drs_month, 
#                  starts_with(c("b_dem_gender", "b_dem_sex", "b_dem_rom", "b_dem_race"))), factor))

#Since "missForest" can only work with categorical variables with a maximum of 53 levels, need to lump 
#together factors. Decided to lump those with less than 10 responses.
#cope_ca_ssi_completers <- cope_ca_ssi_completers %>%
#  mutate(across(starts_with("b_dem"),
#                ~ fct_lump_min(., 10)))

#When running "missForest()" on 8/14/25 on macOS (see "2025.08.17_sessionInfo_for_cleaning_script.txt"),
#we got an "incorrect cutoff specified" error. Although we could not reproduce this error on Windows 11, 
#we resolved it on macOS using the code below, which removes factor variables with levels other than 2.
#factors_not_two_levels <- names(Filter(function(x) is.factor(x) && nlevels(x) != 2, cope_ca_ssi_completers))
#factors_not_two_levels

#cope_ca_ssi_completers_2 <- cope_ca_ssi_completers %>%
#  select(-all_of(factors_not_two_levels))

#set.seed(12345) #For reproducibility
#cope_ca_data_imputed <- missForest(cope_ca_ssi_completers_2)

#cope_ca_data_imputed$OOBerror
#NRMSE = 0.21. This is the error term for the continuous variables.
#PFC = 0.04. This is the error term for the categorical variables.

#Turn the imputed data into its own object
#cope_ca_data_imputed <- as.data.frame(cope_ca_data_imputed$ximp)
